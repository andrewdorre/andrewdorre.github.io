    <!--I'm having a really hard time getting the input fields
    to simply float to the right of the labels for them. Float 
    doesn't really act the way I want, and inline-block, or inline
    I tried padding, I just can't get it to do what I want
    without putting it in a table!-->

    All photos were downloaded from pexels.com. They let me set custom sizes, so I could make them all the same dimensions.
    I set them all for 1920x911. Leaving this note in case I want to go back for more. Then I set them to 50% size for now. Website is
    not really responsive at all at this point, but I just wanted to get something up to start with.

    <h3>This page is devoted to my current classes: PHP (CIS166AE), JavaScript (CIS166AA) and C# Level 2 (CIS262AD)</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The plan is to provide some helpful details for each programming language, and hopefully help myself, and maybe someone else
        <br/> to better understand them! The primary focus will be the JavaScript class, since the site will be updated
        <br/>and maintained specifically for credit in that class. I'm also hoping to use this page to highlight some of the tricks
        <br/>I have learned in each language, and display some of them here.
