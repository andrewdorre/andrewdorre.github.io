       I used several debugging techniques from the chapter. At first I ran into a problem where my script didn't appear to be doing anything.
       Pretty soon I realized that I hadn't added a reference to the script into my html document. Woops! Embarrassing. I don't know if that
       counts as basic troubleshooting, but reading over the code helped for sure. Next, I ran into a problem with the output. Once a name was entered,
       I wasn't receiving anything back, or I wasn't getting what I wanted. I used the debugging tools in Chrome and Edge and put a breakpoint into
       my formstuff.js file right after the first name variable is filled with "document.getElementbyId("firstname");"
       Looking at the variable after the breakpoint paused the program, I noticed that it had "[object HTMLInputElement]", which told me that
       I wasn't putting the right data into the variable. After a bit I figured out that I needed to include the "value" method on the end of
       getElementById().

       As you can probably see in the code, I also included a try..catch statement. Originally the plan was simply to catch if the user
       left either, or both fields blank, and throw up an alert window. But I figured, what if the user inputs a number? I researched a bit,
       and found that there's a fairly simple method that stops a user from entering text into a field that requires numbers (not a number, NaN),
       but doing the reverse and allowing text instead of numbers was not so easy. I was familiar with regular expressions, and found a mention
       of one in a stackoverflow post that did what I wanted. Now I have exceptions for when the first OR last name fields are empty, and also
       if the first OR last name fields do not contain alphabet characters. Unfortunately a user could still input a single letter in each, but
       I guess this is a decent start.

       Finally, I added a finally statement (no pun intended). This is pretty simple, but it clears the input fields so that if a user
       entered information incorrectly, they don't have to delete existing data. Mostly quality of life, but it's a nice touch I think! Also,
       I noticed in the debugger that, even though I included a reference to the modernizr script in the code, I forgot to copy the js file over.
       I copied it over and that took care of the error!
